In this repo i create a simple form with name, surname and email,
I use the hooks and form handling in React.js

When i put the datas and press send, it will clean the form and then list the elements each time more and more below.

This is based on <a href="https://www.nicolas-schurmann.com/">Nicolas Schurmann<a>'s React course
